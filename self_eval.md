# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    I struggled to find the new methods, but once I found them I was golden. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    Note taking is definitely helpful. I needed a little refresher on the each syntax today, and having some scribbles from yesterday helped. 
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    I only googled for new methods, otherwise I solved the problems on my own.
